# Clients_segmentation

Olist (a Brazilian e-commerce site) requested a customer segmentation to support its e-commerce teams in daily communication campaigns. The goal is to understand the different types of users through their behavior and personal data.

This segmentation should provide the marketing team with an actionable description of each segment and the underlying logic to facilitate optimal use. Additionally, a maintenance contract proposal should be prepared based on an analysis of segment stability over time.

Unsupervised methods will be used to group clients with similar profiles.
