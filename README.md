# Clients_segmentation

**Olist** (a Brazilian e-commerce site) wanted us to provide its e-commerce teams with a **customer segmentation** that they could use on a daily basis for their communication campaigns.
The aim is to **understand the different types of users** thanks to their behavior and personal data.
We need to **provide the marketing team with an actionable** description of our segmentation and its underlying logic for optimal use, as well as a **proposal for a maintenance  contract** based on an analysis of segment stability over time.
